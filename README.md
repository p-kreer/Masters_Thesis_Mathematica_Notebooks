# Masters_Thesis_Mathematica_Notebooks
These are the Mathematica notebooks reffered to in my Master's thesis

The file DoubleBoxMassless is the notebook containing the details of Chapter 2 of the Master's thesis. The notebook works with Mathematica 12 
and does not require any additional packages.

The file FIREReductionRules.mx is a Mathematica format file, which contains the reductions of the Feynman integrals to the Master interals. They were computed with FIRE6 (see main text.)

All files must be in the same directory, otherwise the reduction rules cannot be loaded.
